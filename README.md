CLI Trivia Game

**Current Functionality:**
- Welcomes the user to the game
- Displays questions one by one
- Checks for user input if the answer made was correct or not
- Checks if user enters a value out of bounds of the answer choices


**What I plan to add:**
- Add scoring to display how many questions were answered correctly.
- Add a feature to to prompt the user to answer a certain amount of questions.
